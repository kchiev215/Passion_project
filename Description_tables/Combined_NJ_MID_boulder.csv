Start on the horizontal crack a little more than halfway up the boulder. The really good foothold on the left, at the start of the problem is off; the first move was way too easy with that foot.  The right arete is also off. From the start, go right hand to a solid crimp, then left hand to a gaston. Get your left foot up super high to the starting crack, and move to the good horizontal crack near the top of the boulder. Match, and top out.The crux move is definitely moving from the gaston to the horizontal crack.  The best way we found to make this move was to get your left foot super high.The holds are not terrible - most of them are tiny crimps, but this is a slab problem.  What makes this climb tough is the absolute lack of feet; make use of any small divot in the rock that you can."

This problem has it all: a natural line up an impressive boulder with great moves on cool holds. The rock quality is very good and the crux getting over the bulge is exciting and just tricky enough. It is the exact opposite of all the short and contrived diabase problems with bad landings. If you find this problem too easy just step right to Blood Sport for another exhilarating classic.The problem starts standing with the left hand on a pinch and right hand on an edge. Make some interesting moves on good holds following the bulge up and right to join Blood Sport. Fight your way over the bulge on some tricky incuts and top out. The crux is about 10 feet off the ground but the fall is clean and the landing is flat. The topout slab is easy.
