# Rockamendation
## Part 1 
Using the 8a.nu Climbing Logbook, I will be evaluating if weight, height, and length of time an individual has been climbing affects their abilities to complete boulder routes of a higher difficulty level.

## Part 2
Next, I will be using the route information from MountainProject.com to create a database which includes the name of the route, location such as state, gorge, area, crag, and subcrag, the location of the route in longitude and latitude, and the description of boulder routes in the Tri-state area (PA, South & Mid NJ, and DE). Once the table is done, I will be uploading it to a SQLite database.

## Part 3
I will be work with a cohort member in the Java program to then create a recommendation app on Spring, which will allow the user to pick the difficulty level of a boulder route and the location they are interested in climbing in. The application will return a list of boulder routes based off the user's choices. There will be a hover-over option which will show the name of the boulder route, a short description, and its location.
