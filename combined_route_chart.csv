Start on the horizontal crack a little more than halfway up the boulder. The really good foothold on the left, at the start of the problem is off; the first move was way too easy with that foot.  The right arete is also off. From the start, go right hand to a solid crimp, then left hand to a gaston. Get your left foot up super high to the starting crack, and move to the good horizontal crack near the top of the boulder. Match, and top out.The crux move is definitely moving from the gaston to the horizontal crack.  The best way we found to make this move was to get your left foot super high.The holds are not terrible - most of them are tiny crimps, but this is a slab problem.  What makes this climb tough is the absolute lack of feet; make use of any small divot in the rock that you can.",https://www.mountainproject.com/route/112061135/death-grips-slab

Make some interesting moves on good holds following the bulge up and right to join Blood Sport. Fight your way over the bulge on some tricky incuts and top out.

Either make a reachy dynamic throw to the lip, or calf hook into the flare and use an undercling to wrestle your way into an insecure heel/toe cam then reach for the lip. Either method is very committing and having a spotter would be very nice psychological pro.

Pretend you are standing on a ledge ten thousand feet up. Proceed through the easy Orangutan/Jungle Traverse, which is an excellent warm-up. Stem through the dihedral. Throw a calf up and around the corner and step up high to keep things easy or stay low around the corner for a challenge. Down-climb or stay low to continue traversing through some wide reaches until reaching another good resting spot. Breeze through a long easy section and then take a rest before the cave. Continue into the cave, being aware of the sharp boulder under your back. Climb up and out of the cave to the right, watching for loose blocks.
